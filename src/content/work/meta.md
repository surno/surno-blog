### Oculus OS Runtime

Upgraded VROS from Android 8 → 11 by auditing functional changes and refactoring three core system services with forward‑compatibility hooks, keeping future migrations low‑risk.

Designed and built the Quest 2 Wi‑Fi onboarding dialog, elevating UI/UX to release‑grade polish and enabling seamless first‑boot networking for a fully standalone headset.

Partnered with the New User Experience (NUX) team to harden connectivity edge‑cases, achieving 99.9 % first‑boot Wi‑Fi success across > 1 M devices.

Guided QA engineers in crafting regression suites that validated critical new‑user flows and system reliability on every nightly build.

Collaborated with third‑party XR developers to guarantee > 99.9 % bug‑to‑bug compatibility between OS versions, preserving ecosystem stability during platform upgrades.

### System Insights & Reliability

Architected a stack‑wide telemetry bus adopted by all internal teams, reducing memory footprint 80 % while exposing real‑time performance insights with unstructured schema API.

Built a next‑generation crash‑report service that streams raw ELF core dumps and symbolized backtraces from pre‑production silicon, giving kernel and OS engineers first‑day visibility.

Discovered and patched a critical Android ART bug that had suppressed ~ 90 % of crash reports in legacy tooling, restoring signal for reliability triage.

Closed observability gaps by extending instrumentation to kernel, Application, Native, Javascript, and additional firmware layers, raising crash‑type capture coverage from 35 % to 95 %.
